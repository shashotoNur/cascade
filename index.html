				<h4>Creating Sets and Timers</h4>

					</li>
					<li>
						Give your set a descriptive name by clicking on the default name and typing your desired name.
					</li>
					<li>
						Timers cannot exist outside of sets. Click the <strong>+</strong> symbol in the "Timers" column
						within a specific set to create a new timer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Assign a duration (e.g., 25 minutes) to your timer by clicking on the white box and entering the
						desired time. Click "Save" to confirm.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Scheduling Sets</h4>

				<ol>

					</li>
					<li>
						Enter the desired start time for the set using the time input format.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click the "Not scheduled" button again to toggle it to "Scheduled". The set will now activate at
						the designated time.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Editing and Managing Timers and Sets</h4>

						<strong>Renaming:</strong> Click directly on the current name of a set or timer and type the
						desired new name.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Alerts:</strong> Check the box next to "Alert" for a timer to ensure you receive a
						notification when it finishes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Deleting:</strong> Click the delete icon next to a set or timer to remove it completely.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Running Timers</h4>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Click the "Start" button next to the timer you want to run.
					</li>
					<li>
						The timer will move to the "Active Timer" column and begin counting down.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Working with Active Timers</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Pause/Resume:</strong> Click the "Pause" or "Resume" button to control the timer's
						progress.

						<strong>Stop:</strong> Click the "Stop" button to completely end the timer and remove it from
						the "Active Timer" column.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Editing:</strong> Click on the timer within the "Active Timer" column to adjust its
						duration or other settings.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Skipping:</strong> Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons (if available) to navigate
						between timers within the active set.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Adjusting Time:</strong> Click the white box next to the current timer duration and
						adjust the value to add or remove time from the ongoing execution. Click "Save" to confirm the
						change.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Reordering and Data Management</h4>

					Drag and drop sets and timers within their respective columns to rearrange them according to your
					preference. Access the export and import functions from the navbar to save and load your data sets.
				</p>

				<p>
					Click the "Sync" button in the navbar to instantly launch any set that is scheduled for the current
					time.
				</p>

				<h4>App Information</h4>

				<p>
					Click on the app title to open a modal displaying details about the app.
				</p>

				<p>
